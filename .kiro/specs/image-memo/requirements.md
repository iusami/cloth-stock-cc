# Requirements Document

## Introduction

画像にメモ情報を追加する機能を実装します。ユーザーは衣服の写真に対して自由形式のテキストメモを追加でき、そのメモ内容を検索で見つけることができるようになります。この機能により、タグだけでは表現しきれない詳細な情報（購入場所、着用シーン、コーディネートのアイデアなど）を記録し、後から効率的に検索できるようになります。

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to add memo text to clothing images, so that I can record detailed information that cannot be expressed through tags alone.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user views a clothing item detail THEN system SHALL display a memo input field
2. WHEN user enters memo text THEN system SHALL save the memo text associated with the clothing item
3. WHEN user saves memo text THEN system SHALL validate that memo text does not exceed 1000 characters
4. WHEN memo text exceeds character limit THEN system SHALL display an error message
5. WHEN user leaves memo field empty THEN system SHALL allow saving with empty memo

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to edit existing memo text, so that I can update or correct previously recorded information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user views a clothing item with existing memo THEN system SHALL display the current memo text in the input field
2. WHEN user modifies memo text THEN system SHALL update the memo in the database
3. WHEN user clears memo text THEN system SHALL save empty memo for the clothing item
4. WHEN memo update fails THEN system SHALL display error message and retain original memo

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to search clothing items by memo content, so that I can find items based on detailed information I recorded.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user enters search query THEN system SHALL search both tags and memo content
2. WHEN search query matches memo text THEN system SHALL include the item in search results
3. WHEN search query partially matches memo content THEN system SHALL include the item in results
4. WHEN search is case-insensitive THEN system SHALL find matches regardless of case
5. WHEN search query contains special characters THEN system SHALL handle them appropriately

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see memo preview in the gallery view, so that I can quickly identify items with detailed information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clothing item has memo text THEN system SHALL display memo indicator in gallery view
2. WHEN memo text is longer than display area THEN system SHALL show truncated preview with ellipsis
3. WHEN user taps memo preview THEN system SHALL navigate to detail view with memo field focused
4. WHEN clothing item has no memo THEN system SHALL not display memo indicator

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want memo data to be persisted locally, so that my memo information is preserved across app sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user adds memo to clothing item THEN system SHALL store memo in local database
2. WHEN app is restarted THEN system SHALL retain all memo data
3. WHEN clothing item is deleted THEN system SHALL also delete associated memo data
4. WHEN database migration occurs THEN system SHALL preserve existing memo data

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want memo functionality to be accessible, so that users with disabilities can use the feature effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN memo input field is focused THEN system SHALL provide appropriate content description for screen readers
2. WHEN memo indicator is displayed THEN system SHALL include accessibility label
3. WHEN memo text is displayed THEN system SHALL ensure sufficient color contrast
4. WHEN user navigates with keyboard THEN system SHALL support proper focus management for memo fields
