# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Gallery Tag Editing feature enables users to select clothing item images from the gallery view and modify their associated tags through an intuitive editing interface. This feature builds upon the existing photo tagging functionality by providing a seamless workflow for users to update and maintain their clothing metadata directly from the gallery. The feature focuses on improving the user experience for managing existing clothing items by making tag editing easily accessible and efficient.
