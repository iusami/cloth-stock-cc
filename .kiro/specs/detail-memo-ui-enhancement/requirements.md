# Requirements Document

## Introduction

画像詳細画面でのメモ機能のUI/UX改善を実装します。現在のメモ機能では背景が透過しているためメモが非常に見づらい状況です。この問題を解決するため、メモに背景色を追加し、同時に詳細情報エリアを上下スワイプで表示・非表示切り替えできる機能を実装します。これにより、メモの視認性を向上させつつ、画像の全体表示も可能にします。

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want memo text to have a background color, so that I can read memo content clearly even when the image behind has similar colors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user views clothing item detail with memo THEN system SHALL display memo text with semi-transparent background
2. WHEN memo background is displayed THEN system SHALL ensure sufficient contrast ratio for accessibility
3. WHEN memo text is empty THEN system SHALL not display background area
4. WHEN memo background is applied THEN system SHALL maintain rounded corners for visual appeal
5. WHEN memo text spans multiple lines THEN system SHALL extend background to cover all text lines

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to swipe up and down to show/hide the detail information area, so that I can view the full image when needed while still having access to memo and other details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user swipes up on detail information area THEN system SHALL hide the detail panel with smooth animation
2. WHEN user swipes down on hidden detail area THEN system SHALL show the detail panel with smooth animation
3. WHEN detail panel is hidden THEN system SHALL display full-screen image view
4. WHEN detail panel is shown THEN system SHALL display memo, tags, and other item information
5. WHEN swipe gesture is too short THEN system SHALL return panel to original position

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want visual indicators for the swipe functionality, so that I can understand how to interact with the detail information area.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN detail panel is visible THEN system SHALL display swipe handle indicator at top of panel
2. WHEN detail panel is hidden THEN system SHALL display small indicator at bottom of screen to show panel can be pulled up
3. WHEN user starts swiping THEN system SHALL provide visual feedback during gesture
4. WHEN swipe handle is displayed THEN system SHALL include appropriate accessibility labels
5. WHEN user taps swipe handle THEN system SHALL toggle panel visibility as alternative to swiping

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the swipe functionality to work smoothly with different screen sizes, so that the feature is consistent across various Android devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN app runs on different screen sizes THEN system SHALL adapt swipe thresholds appropriately
2. WHEN device is in landscape orientation THEN system SHALL maintain swipe functionality
3. WHEN device is in portrait orientation THEN system SHALL optimize panel height for content visibility
4. WHEN system detects low-end device THEN system SHALL use simplified animations for better performance
5. WHEN swipe conflicts with other gestures THEN system SHALL prioritize appropriate gesture based on context

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the panel state to be remembered during the session, so that my preferred viewing mode is maintained when navigating between items.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user hides detail panel THEN system SHALL remember hidden state for current session
2. WHEN user navigates to another item THEN system SHALL apply same panel state (hidden/shown)
3. WHEN user rotates device THEN system SHALL maintain current panel state
4. WHEN app is backgrounded and resumed THEN system SHALL restore last panel state
5. WHEN new app session starts THEN system SHALL default to panel shown state

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the memo background and swipe functionality to be accessible, so that users with disabilities can use these features effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN memo background is applied THEN system SHALL ensure minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio with text
2. WHEN swipe handle is displayed THEN system SHALL provide appropriate content description for screen readers
3. WHEN panel state changes THEN system SHALL announce state change to accessibility services
4. WHEN user navigates with keyboard/switch control THEN system SHALL provide alternative methods to toggle panel
5. WHEN high contrast mode is enabled THEN system SHALL adjust memo background accordingly

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth animations during panel transitions, so that the interface feels responsive and polished.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN panel slides up/down THEN system SHALL use smooth easing animation with appropriate duration
2. WHEN animation is in progress THEN system SHALL prevent conflicting gestures
3. WHEN user interrupts animation with new gesture THEN system SHALL smoothly transition to new target state
4. WHEN device has reduced motion settings enabled THEN system SHALL use minimal or no animations
5. WHEN animation completes THEN system SHALL update panel state and accessibility focus appropriately
