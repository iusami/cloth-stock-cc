# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Gallery Filter and Search feature enables users to efficiently find specific clothing items within their collection through intuitive filtering and search capabilities. This feature enhances the existing gallery view by providing multiple ways to narrow down the displayed clothing items based on tags (size, color, category) and text-based search. The feature focuses on improving user experience when managing large clothing collections by making item discovery fast and intuitive.
